# Document Analysis Web Application

## Overview

The **Document Analysis Web Application** is designed to allow users to upload scanned PDF documents and receive a detailed text analysis. Using **Azure's Document Intelligence service**, the application extracts and processes text data from PDF files and provides valuable insights such as word counts, character counts, sentence counts, word frequency, and more. 

This project aims to create a seamless, responsive, and user-friendly experience for analyzing documents online.

## Support for Multiple Languages

- This application supports **Only PDF files** in multiple languages, provided the text within the PDF is extractable by Azure's Document Intelligence service.

## Design Decisions & Trade-offs

- **Azure Integration**:  
  - The choice to use **Azure Document Intelligence** was made for its high-quality text extraction and analysis capabilities. This provided a reliable solution for our file processing needs.
  
- **Frontend Framework**:  
  - We used **React** with **TypeScript** for its component-based architecture and scalability. This allows easy maintenance and modularity in the application.
  
- **File Upload**:  
  - The **drag-and-drop** file upload interface is simple, intuitive, and responsive, providing an excellent user experience across devices.
  
- **Performance Considerations**:  
  - **Azureâ€™s cloud services** handle text extraction, ensuring efficient processing, while **React** provides smooth updates to the UI during document analysis.

## Future Improvements

- **Multi-language support**:  
  Expand to support **multiple languages** for text analysis (e.g., by utilizing more Azure language models).
  
- **Text Summary**:  
  Implement a feature that summarizes the document content for faster insights.
  
- **Advanced Word Analysis**:  
  Implement a more sophisticated word analysis tool, offering the ability to visualize word clouds or contextual analysis of frequent words.

- **Local Document Storage**:  
  Enable users to download processed analysis results in various formats (e.g., PDF, CSV).
